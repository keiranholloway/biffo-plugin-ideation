# Terraform for the Ideation Engine's frontend hosting (ADR-0018 §2).
#
# `biffo plugin install ideation` copies this directory into the instance's
# monorepo at modules/plugins/ideation/ and generates the instantiating module
# block into infra/environments/<env>/plugins.generated.tf (CLI-owned).
#
# This module provisions ONLY the plugin's static frontend origin now — the
# backend Lambda + API Gateway ingress it used to provision (ADR-0018 §1) was
# torn down when ideation migrated onto the shared plugin host (ADR-0021,
# biffo-platform PR #48/#49): the frontend calls the already-live shared host
# at /api/v1/plugins/ideation instead. ADR-0018 §2's per-plugin frontend
# hosting (a static app under its own S3 origin, routed at <base>/ideation/*
# via the shared CloudFront's sibling_origins) remains current until ADR-0021's
# shared app-shell lands (biffo-template#558, not started) — so this bucket
# stays, unlike the backend it used to sit beside.
