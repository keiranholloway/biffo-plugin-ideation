"""The real ``Transport`` for the HTTP CoreGateway — the only piece that touches
the network (ADR-0017 §3/§5).

Every call to Core's internal API is **dual-authenticated**: SigV4-signed as the
plugin's Lambda role (via the SDK's ``SignedCoreClient``, so Core's
``require_service_principal`` accepts it) *and* carrying the founder's Cognito
token in ``X-Biffo-User-Token``, which Core re-verifies to establish identity and
owner-scope. The plugin's own ingress already verified that token to admit the
request; forwarding it lets Core be the authority (the plugin is defence-in-depth).

Built by subclassing ``SignedCoreClient`` to reuse its signing verbatim, adding
only: arbitrary methods (the owner-data updates are ``PATCH``, which the base
client lacks), the forwarded-user header, and the 404→``CoreNotFound`` mapping the
adapter's owner-scoped reads rely on.
