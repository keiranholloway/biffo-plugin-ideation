"""Seed the workflow definition that makes a Brain-Storming session finish unattended.

Brain-Storming fans out to six research agents under one causation chain. Nothing
in the plugin then watches them — the orchestration engine does, via an
``agent_fan_in`` action (biffo-template#657) that fires the synthesis agent once
every research run in the chain is terminal.

Core resolves the synthesis agent's ``instructions`` and ``model`` from the
plugin's seeded config at agent-run creation time, so those fields are no longer
frozen into the workflow definition — an admin's edits to the stored prompt and
model now take effect immediately.

**Without this definition, a session never leaves ``researching``.** The six
research agents still run and still bill; nothing reconciles them. That is the
whole failure mode this script exists to prevent, and it is silent — which is
why it is called out here rather than left to a deploy runbook.

Run this ONCE per environment, by an operator with real Cognito admin
credentials, after the plugin is installed. It is idempotent: an existing
definition with the same name is left alone unless ``--replace`` is passed.

Usage:
    CORE_API_URL=https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com \
    ADMIN_BEARER_TOKEN=<a real Cognito admin id/access token> \
    python scripts/seed_brainstorm_fan_in_workflow.py [--dry-run] [--replace]

#: Core mounts the orchestration router at `/api/v1/orchestration`, NOT under
#: `/api/v1/admin`. This carried a stray `admin/` segment until 2026-08-12,
#: which meant the script 404'd on every run in every environment and had
#: therefore never once seeded a definition — so any session that finished
#: did so on something other than this workflow.
#:
#: Verified in Core's source rather than guessed: the workflow-CRUD router
#: declares `prefix="/orchestration/workflows"`
#: (tabsii-platform `services/api/src/api/routers/orchestration.py:83`) and is
#: mounted with `prefix="/api/v1"` (`services/api/src/api/main.py:117`). The
#: `/api/v1/admin/orchestration` router is a different one that exposes only
#: `/test` (`services/api/src/api/routers/admin/orchestration.py:39,44`), so
#: the `admin/` variant 404s exactly like a route that never existed.
#:
#: The sibling plugin `biffo-plugin-marketing` hit and fixed this identical
#: line first (its #61), and measured it against deployed dev on 2026-08-11:
#: `/api/v1/orchestration/workflows` -> 200 with a valid admin token, the
#: `admin/` variant -> 404.

    """The workflow this plugin needs in order to finish a run on its own.

    Triggered by every ``agent.run.completed``: the fan-in action itself decides
    whether the event belongs to a chain it cares about, and no-ops otherwise.
    That is deliberate — filtering by agent name in the trigger would still fire
    six times per run (once per research agent), and the action's own
    all-siblings-terminal check is what collapses those six into one.

    Carries no ``instructions`` and no ``model``: Core resolves both from the
    plugin's seeded config at agent-run creation, which is what makes an admin's
    edit take effect. This function therefore takes **no model argument** — one
    would be silently ignored, which is the defect (idea-scout#64) this whole
    change removes rather than relocates.
